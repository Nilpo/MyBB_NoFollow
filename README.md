MyBB_NoFollow
=============

NoFollow Website Links plugin for MyBB

This plugin helps preserve PageRank on your site by adding rel="nofollow" to all user website links in the PostBit and on their profile pages.

The original idea was suggested in this tutorial:

I just packaged it in a plugin and added the nofollow to website links on user profiles.
